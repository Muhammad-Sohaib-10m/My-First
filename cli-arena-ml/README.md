# CLI Arena — ML + FastAPI Benchmark

This is a Project Saturn-compatible benchmark repository designed to test LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude on complex CLI tasks.

##  Goal

Each task challenges the model to make file edits, reason about systems, and interact via the command line — simulating real-world software development.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- Pytest
- Docker + Make

##  Task Index

All tasks live under `tasks/`. See `tasks.json` for manifest.
